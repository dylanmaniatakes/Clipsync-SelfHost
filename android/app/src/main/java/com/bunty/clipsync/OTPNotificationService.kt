/**
 * Singleton service responsible for forwarding detected OTP codes from the Android device
 * to the paired Mac via the shared Firestore `notifications` collection.
 *
 * The end-to-end forwarding pipeline works as follows:
 *  1. A caller — typically [OTPListeningService] for SMS-sourced OTPs, or
 *     [EmailOTPListenerService] for email-sourced OTPs — invokes [notifyOTPDetected].
 *  2. The raw OTP string is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the session key established
 *     during the pairing handshake. A fresh 12-byte IV is generated for every message.
 *  3. The encrypted payload, alongside metadata (pairing ID, device ID, device name, and a
 *     server-generated timestamp), is written as a new document to Firestore.
 *  4. The Mac's ClipSync app, which maintains a live snapshot listener on the same collection,
 *     picks up the document within milliseconds, decrypts it with the shared key, and either
 *     copies the OTP to the Mac clipboard or surfaces it in a notification.
 *
 * The encryption scheme intentionally mirrors [FirestoreManager]'s encrypt/decrypt logic so
 * the Mac can use a single decryption path for all payloads received from Firestore.
